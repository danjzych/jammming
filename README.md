# "Jammming" is a portfolio project from the Codecademy Full Stack Developer self-guided course.
# It is part of the front-end development section. This project was built so that users can search Spotify's library, build a playlist in the browser, and then save that playlist to their personal Spotify account.

# This project is built using React, and intended to be an exercise in the student's knowledge of React and API's, up to this point in the course.
